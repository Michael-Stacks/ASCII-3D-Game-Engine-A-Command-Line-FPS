# ASCII-3D-Game-Engine-A-Command-Line-FPS
This project is a First-Person Shooter entirely rendered with ASCII characters in the command line, built from scratch in C++. No graphics libraries, just pure math, creativity, and low-level console manipulation. Experience classic raycasting, depth buffering, and smooth player movement, all within a simple terminal window.
